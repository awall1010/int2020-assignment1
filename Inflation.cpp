// Problem 4 (inflation):
// It is difficult to make a budget that spans several years, because prices are not stable. If your company
// needs 200 pencils per year, you cannot simply use this yearâ€™s price as the cost of pencils two years from
// now. Because of inflation the cost is likely to be higher than it is today. Write a program to gauge the
// expected cost of an item in a specified number of years. The program asks for the cost of the item, the
// number of years from now that the item will be purchased, and the rate of inflation. The program then
// outputs the estimated cost of the item after the specified period. Have the user enter the inflation rate as a
// per- centage, such as 5.6 (percent). Your program should then convert the percentage to a fraction, such
// as 0.056, and should use a loop to estimate the price adjusted for inflation. (Hint: Use a loop.)
